# An Analysis of Election Results

## *The Goal and Methodology*
### In this analysis our goal was to understand the results for each of the candidates. In addition to their results we also want a breakdown of the results by county so we can see what the voter turnout was for each county.

The things we wanted to know in particular are:
1. How did each candidate perform, and who won the popular vote?
2. What was the voter turnout for each county and which one had the best turnout?

## *Election Results by Candidate*
#### When analyzing the election results by candidate we wanted to know the answer to 3 questions: 

1. What percent of the votes did they receive?
2. How many votes did each candidate receive?
3. Who was the winner?

#### Our answers are best presented for each candidate individually:

1. Charles Casper Stockham
    * Percentage of the vote - ***23.0%***
    * Number of votes - ***85,213***

2. Raymon Anthony Doane
    * Percentage of the vote - ***3.1%***
    * Number of votes - ***11,606***

**<ins>And our winner was:</ins>**

3. **Diana DeGette**
    * Percentage of the vote - ***73.8%***
    * Number of votes - ***272,892***

## *Election Results by County*
#### To further analyze the election results we broke the results up by the county and evaluated based on the same questions as before:

1. What percent of the votes came from each county?
2. How many votes came from each county?
3. What county had the best voter turnout?

#### Our answers are best presented for each county individually:

1. Jefferson County
    * Percentage of the vote - ***10.5%***
    * Number of votes - ***38,855***

2. Arapahoe
    * Percentage of the vote - ***6.7%***
    * Number of votes - ***24,801***

**<ins>And our winner was:</ins>**
